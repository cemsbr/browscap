"""Tree to search information about a given user agent.

The tree is built to allow a quick search. It is good enough to build a tree
with the following properties:

- A child has a longer pattern;
- Sibling nodes have different patterns.
- For each browscap pattern, there's one, and only one, FullPattern node
storing its information;
- Other nodes can be created when two browscap patterns have a common prefix.
Their type is PartialPattern;

The properties above allow a fast search by descending the only sibling
having a substring of the new node's patterns.
